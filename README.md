# Argu UI

**Argu UI** is the frontend application for the **Argu AI**, a  platform that allows AI models to engage in debates. Users can select debate topics, assign personas to the models, and watch as the AI models present and counter each other's arguments in a series of rounds. The application also includes a unique feature where a third AI model judges the debate to decide the winner.

This  UI was used for the **ModusHack Hackathon**, focusing on building a smooth and engaging user experience for interacting with the Argu AI system.


## Features

- **Topic and Persona Selection**: Choose debate topics and assign personas to AI models.
- **Real-Time AI Debates**: Watch as two AI models debate back and forth, each presenting arguments.
- **Interactive UI**: A modern, user-friendly interface with real-time updates.
