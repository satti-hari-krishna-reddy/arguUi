# Argu UI

**Argu UI** is the frontend application for the **Argu AI**, a platform that allows AI models to engage in debates. Users can select debate topics, assign personas to the models, and watch as the AI models present and counter each other's arguments in a series of rounds. The application also includes a unique feature where a third AI model judges the debate to decide the winner.

This UI was used for the **ModusHack Hackathon**, focusing on building a smooth and engaging user experience for interacting with the Argu AI system.
